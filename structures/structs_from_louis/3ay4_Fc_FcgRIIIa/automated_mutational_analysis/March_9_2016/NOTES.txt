Native low E pose was made by making 1000 decoys of a 1 by 1 pack and min and picking lowest E structure
** see "automated_mutational_analysis.py, antibody_functions.py, and antibody_protocols.py" for the code that was run
** see "native_crystal_struct_3ay4_Fc_FcgRIII.pdb" for base native 3ay4 pdb used in protocol

Made the 51 point mutations WITHOUT any intitial packing around the mutation area
** see "project_mutant_list.txt" for info on mutants made, including symmetry
** see "mut_structs" dir for the base structures of the mutants that were used

Made 1000 decoys of each mutant using the same 1 by 1 pack min and pulled out the lowest E structs
